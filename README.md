Try-Catch and Basic Async
---

A couple of playgrounds used in class to demonstrate using do-try-catch to handle errors as well as some async code drawn from [Paul Hudson's work](https://github.com/twostraws/whats-new-in-swift-5-5) with some the notes removed and code restructured. (Linked to on the course site as well; definitely check out the original as there material is more at Paul's repo.)
